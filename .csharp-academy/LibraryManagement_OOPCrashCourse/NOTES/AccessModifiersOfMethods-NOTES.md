➡️ Public: It's the most accessible modifier, allowing members to be accessed from any part of the code in the same assembly or from other assemblies. It ensures that the member is available to all.

➡️ Private: It's the most restrictive modifier, limiting access to the containing class only. Members marked as private cannot be accessed from outside the class, ensuring full encapsulation of the class's implementation details.

➡️ Protected: Allows access within the containing class and any class that inherits from it. This modifier is useful when you want derived classes to access certain members but still restrict access from the outside.

➡️ Internal: Limits access to the current assembly, meaning that any type or member marked as internal can only be accessed by other types within the same project but not by other assemblies.

➡️ Protected Internal: It's a combination of protected and internal, allowing access either from within the same assembly or from a derived class in another assembly. It offers flexibility when sharing access across inheritance hierarchies and assemblies.

➡️ Private protected: It's the most restrictive of all inheritance-access modifiers, allowing access only from within the containing class or types derived from the class but only within the same assembly. This ensures that members are not exposed to derived classes from other assemblies.
