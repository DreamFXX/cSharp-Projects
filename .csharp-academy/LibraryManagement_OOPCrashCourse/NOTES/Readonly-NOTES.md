- In C#, the readonly keyword is used to specify that a field can only be assigned once, either when it's declared or in the constructor of the class. Once assigned, the value of a readonly field cannot be modified. It ensures that the field's value remains constant after its initial assignment, providing a safeguard for certain variables to avoid accidental modification later in the code.
