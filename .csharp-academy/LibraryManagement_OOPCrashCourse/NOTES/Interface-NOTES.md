- An interface defines a contract that classes can implement. It specifies what a class must do, but not how it does it. Unlike abstract classes, interfaces cannot contain implementation details (prior to C# 8.0; newer versions allow default implementations, but we'll focus on the traditional usage for clarity).

- Interfaces and Abstract Classes are very similar, particularly after interfaces started allowing default implementations. The most important difference is that a class can implement from multiple interfaces and that's not the case with Abstract classes. Let's see an example.

-> **Interface-Showcase.cs** -> Here our dog inherits from multiple interfaces. That's a very common scenario in real applications, since each interface encapsulates a set of related properties and methods. Classes might inherit from difference interfaces as they need those set of members. A good way to think about it is that we should create interfaces so that they're used in a "per need" basis.
