- In C#, tuples are lightweight data structures that allow you to store a sequence of elements of different types. They are particularly useful for returning multiple values from a method without having to define a separate class or struct. Introduced in C# 7.0, tuples have evolved to become more powerful and user-friendly, especially with the introduction of value tuples.
