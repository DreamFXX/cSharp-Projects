- Abstraction in OOP refers to creating a simplified model that represents only the essential features of an object while ignoring irrelevant details. It allows you to focus on what an object is and does at a high level, without worrying about the inner workings. For instance, when you model a Book in your class, you're focusing on attributes like Name and Pages, which are relevant for your application, while ignoring more intricate details like how the book is printed or how the paper is made. In this sense, abstraction helps you create a manageable, conceptual model of a real-world entity.

- This concept is closely related to the Encapsulation principle we've learned previously. To recap: Encapsulation, on the other hand, focuses on bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (the class) and restricting access to some of that data.
