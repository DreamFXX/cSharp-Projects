Console based CRUD application to track time spent coding. Developed using C# and SQLite.
I used Visual Studio IDE for creation of this project.

## !! FIRST OF ALL

- **set **Working Directory** to path that you have your solution (.sln) file. Otherwise, App wont work!**

## Revision of this project from C# Academy

- <https://github.com/TheCSharpAcademy/CodeReviews.Console.HabitTracker/pull/225>

Given Requirements:

- When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.
- It should also create a table in the database, where the hours will be logged.
- You need to be able to insert, delete, update and view your logged hours.
- You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes
- The application should only be terminated when the user inserts 0.
- You can only interact with the database using raw SQL. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework
- Reporting Capabilities
